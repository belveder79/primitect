Create subfolders:

```
mkdir planes
mkdir spheres
mkdir cylinders
mkdir cones
mkdir all
```

Then open Matlab, and from there, run `render_scripts/RenderSyntheticAll.m`:
```
RenderSyntheticAll
```

The files `717416.ply` and `717416.xyz` are example files that can be used to test the algorithm without generating your own data.
