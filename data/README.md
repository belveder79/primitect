# Data

## Redwood data (*primitive-rw*)

We provide the scripts we were using to obtain the data from the [Redwood dataset](http://redwood-data.org/3dscan/dataset.html) in the folder `data/redwood_lod/`.

## Synthetic data (*primitect*)

The Matlab script `RenderSyntheticAll.m` in `data/primitect/` will generate random point clouds of the same type as those we were using for our evaluation, and refer to as `primitect` dataset in the paper.
